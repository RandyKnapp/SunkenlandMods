No Bedtime
by randyknapp

Description:
Configurable bedtime. Adds an 'alarm' mode, to wake up at the same time every day.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
Works in multiplayer so long as everyone uses the same config!

Config:
SleepHoursOverride: The number of in-game hours to pass when sleeping. If set to -1, does not override the game's default value (10 hours).
BedtimeHoursOverride: The number of in-game hours before you can sleep again. If set to -1, does not override the game's default value (24 hours).
AlarmHour: What time of day to wake, regardless of when you slept. If set to -1, does nothing. If in use, 'Sleep Hours Override' is ignored.
