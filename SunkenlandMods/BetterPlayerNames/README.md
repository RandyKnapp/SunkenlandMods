Better Player Names
by randyknapp

Description:
Configurable player name display settings. They always appear but can optionally be hidden after a certain distance. They have a black outline. They scale down the farther away the player is. They show the distance to the player.

Config:
NearThreshold: Distance before the player name begins scaling down.
FarThreshold: Maximum distance to scale the player name.
HiddenThreshold: If greater than zero, if the player is farther than this threshold, the player name does not show.
NearScale: Scale of the player name when it is at or closer than the Near Threshold.
FarScale: Scale of the player name when it is at or farther than the Far Threshold.
